# Wave-Function-Collapse

Straight out of quantum mechanics, **Wave Function Collapse** (WFC) is an algorithm for procedural generation of images. This repository features **two approaches** to the WFC: the **Tiled Model** (Coding Challenge 171) and the **Overlapping Model** (Coding Challenge #186). Both implementations are available in JavaScript (p5.js) and ported to Processing (Java).

## Overview

Wave Function Collapse is a constraint-satisfaction algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics. At a high level, you have:

1. **Tiles** (or ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù) that can appear in each cell.
2. **Adjacency rules** describing which tiles can appear next to each other.
3. **Entropy** that helps decide which cell to collapse (choose a tile for) next.
4. **Propagation** to eliminate invalid tiles from neighbors as constraints tighten.

### Completed

- [x] Implementation of Tile Model (Challenge 171)
