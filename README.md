# Wave-Function-Collapse

Straight out of quantum mechanics, Wave Function Collapse is an algorithm for procedural generation of images. In this video (recorded over 3 live streams) I attempt the tiled model and explore a variety of solutions to the algorithm in JavaScript with p5.js.

## Plan

### Completed

- [x] Implementation of Tile Model (see: https://youtu.be/rI_y2GAlQFM)

### Corrections

- [ ] Additional Rules for tiles 4 and 5
- [ ] Explain how Computed Property Names could have been used (see: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Wave-Function-Collapse/issues/35)

### Next Steps and Refactoring

- [ ] Filter out redundant tiles
- [ ] Recursive entropy reduction
- [ ] Shannon entropy

### Future work

- [ ] Overlapping model
