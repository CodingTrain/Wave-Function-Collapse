# Wave-Function-Collapse

Straight out of quantum mechanics, **Wave Function Collapse** (WFC) is an algorithm for procedural generation of images. This repository features **two approaches** to the WFC: the **Tiled Model** (Coding Challenge 171) and the **Overlapping Model** (Coding Challenge #186). Both implementations are available in JavaScript (p5.js) and ported to Processing (Java).

## Overview

Wave Function Collapse is a constraint-satisfaction algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics. At a high level, you have:

1. **Tiles** (or ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù) that can appear in each cell.
2. **Adjacency rules** describing which tiles can appear next to each other.
3. **Entropy** that helps decide which cell to collapse (choose a tile for) next.
4. **Propagation** to eliminate invalid tiles from neighbors as constraints tighten.

### Completed

- [x] Implementation of Tile Model (Challenge 171)
- [x] Implementation of Overlapping Model (Challenge 186)
- [x] Processing (Java) ports for both models

## Community Contributions and Improvements

- [TileGrid Helper Class](https://github.com/jonnytest1/Wave-Function-Collapse/tree/main) by [@jonnytest1](https://github.com/jonnytest1) A generic grid layout approach using p5.js vectors, making it easier to unify directional logic and reference valid neighboring positions.
- [Grid Update Optimization](https://github.com/gverger/Wave-Function-Collapse/tree/optim-updates): [Pull Request #40](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Wave-Function-Collapse/pull/40) introduces a more efficient method for updating grid cells by propagating changes only to affected cells, which improves performance and accuracy. The drawing process is also optimized, allowing multiple updates per tick, speeding up the overall process.
